# Task

`Task` is a command line application written in NodeJS that allows teams to crisply manage units of work.

In the future, look for features which will allow you and your team to:

  - Ask Alexa about the status of a work item or project.
  - Get a diff of the burndown between yesterday and today.
  - Create email threads which structure the task audit log in a way similar to how the tasks are listed in the command line.

# New Features!

  - Specify the --upload flag to `task add` to upload your tasks to S3!
